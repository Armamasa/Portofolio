- Please take a look inside the Testing Document for information of my testing documentation.
- Please look inside the AutomationRFM to see a bit of what I learned from RobotFramework 
- API and SQL folder is only information or note about what API testing and SQL testing is. 

What I need to do as a QA Analyst?

1. First of all, I need to make a template for: Test Plan, Test Case, Bug report, Sign off document, Graph to list my activities.
- Test Plan contains of Feature documentation, Screening result, Objective of testing, People in charge, What I need to test, What I don't need to test, What method I will use, Entry checklist for testing, Time of testing, Tester PIC
- Test Case template contains: Test Scenario ID, Test Scenario Desc, Test Case ID, Test Case Desc, Test Steps, Precondition, Test Data, Post Condition, Expected Result, Actual Result, Status, Executed by, Executed date, Comment
- Bug report contains: Title, Bug Description of how i found the bug, Test data, Steps, Expected and Actual result, Attachment, Log if any.
- Sign off document that contains: PIC, document, left over issue after UAT, sign off from EM as a proof that the feature is good to go.

2. Execute every steps as perfect as I can. 
3. After development process finished, do the UAT with product team
4. After UAT finished and if the feature is good to go, engineer merged the feature to production. QA do the regression test there.
5. After release, QA do a version testing and smoke testing. 
6. Finally maintain the document testing and release bug.
